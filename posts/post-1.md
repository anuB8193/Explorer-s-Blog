## Day 42: The Forgotten Moon

Stardate: 3042.7  
Location: Uncharted System, Sector 12

I arrived on a barren, desolate moon orbiting a dying star. The surface is littered with ruins, remnants of a civilization long forgotten. Yet, within the ruins, faint traces of power still linger. Who built this place? And why did they abandon it?

As I explore, my suitâ€™s scanner picks up something unsettling: a faint signal, almost like a whisper.
