## Day 97: The Edge of the Known Universe

Stardate: 3071.4  
Location: The Galactic Frontier

I have reached the edge—the boundary between what we know and the abyss beyond. Stars thin out, and the void stretches endlessly. My ship’s AI warns me: "Uncharted territory. Proceed with caution."

But caution is not why I came here.

I activate the thrusters, crossing into the unknown.
